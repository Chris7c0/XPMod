## Zoey- [Rdz3's concept, Medic Focused v2]

Talent 1 - (Resilient Pickup)
Zoey is able to pickup allies faster and provide them with resilience for a few seconds. 
Zoey picks up Allies 5% faster per level. [25% max]
Allies revived by teammates get 4% damage reduction per level for 7 seconds. [20% max]
Addendum: Damage reduction was reduced based on feed back.

Talent 3 - (Survivor's Will)
Zoey is motivated to keep fighting for others at the risk to herself.
-2 hp per talent level.  (-10 hp at max)
Increased survivor in capped health +20 per level [100 max] [is shared globally, does not stack with other Zoey's]
Increased movement speed 3% per level. [15% max]
+3% Damage reduction when incapped per talent level. [15% max when downed.]

Addendum: Zoey having damage reduction passively always was presented as a.. balancing issue.  So we shifted it to only when she goes down or uses her bind 2.  Limiting both the presence of the power and availability.  As a result, reduced the hp she lost per talent level to better balance Zoey.

Talent 4 - (Sharing is Caring)
Zoey near X Units around her gets the benefit of any healing she provides per level.
At talent level 5, pills and adrenaline shots provide actual health instead of temp health on shared hp only.
Units around her 7/9/11/13/15 feet per talent level. [15 feet max.]
Medkit- 5% shared per level. [25% max shared benefit]
Pills- 10% per level. [50% max shared benefit]
Adrenaline- 16% per level. [80% max shared benefit]

Addendum: Due to balancing concerns, the aoe heal radius has been lowered and medkit/pills/adrenaline power was lowered due to talent 5.  Pills and Adrenaline only give Zoey temp health but still provide aoe healing.  Note that the Aoe Heal does not effect Zoey.

Talent 5 - (Medical Expertise)
Zoey's efficiency on healing items is improved.
5% Faster use per level. [25% max]

10% Boosted healing per level on medkits. [50% max increase]
8% Boosted healing per level on pills.  [40% max increase]
12% Boosted healing per level on Adrenaline. [60% max Increase]

Addendum: Healing boost was too strong, paired with Talent 4, made aoe healing a concern.  Effectiveness Lowered.

Talent 6 - (Scrap Recycle)
Upon Helping her team, Zoey pockets  items which eventually gives free  medkits/pills.
After picking up her team [8/7/6/5/4] times (amount based per talent level)] gain +1 medkit
After picking up her team [7/6/5/4/3] times (amount based per talent level)] gain +1 pills.
Team gains 33% reduced bile duration.

Addendum: reworked in being easier to understand and to work better into the new bind 1.  Feedback to reduce the power of it and limit healing as well.  Removal of gaining adrenaline to better balance the new Bind 1. Bile reduction added as a new team support idea.

Bind 1 - (Sacrificial Aid)
Zoey can choose to give up the following: Medkit, Pills, or Adrenaline.  To give a survivor the following.
If the chosen Survivor is up:
Medkit- 50/75/100 instant heal. (Global range)
Pills- 50/60/70 temp health. (Global Range)
Adrenaline- 30/35/40 actual health.  (Global Range)
Power every other level after the 1st talent.

Unlocked at talent level 5.
If the chosen Survivor is downed:
Medkit- Instant pickup.
Pills- 150+ incapped health.
Adrenaline- Stops bleed out and gain 33% damage reduction.

Addendum: Bind 2 original was too power focused for a medical core job.  On top of Instant Intervention being a strong bind made Zoey having 2 powerful binds.  This weaker bind should offer players options when it comes to making use of Zoey's talents for healings.  Or when things get dire, sacrifice her healing items.


Bind 2 - (Instant Intervention) 
Zoey is able to warp at an allies location and provides an aoe healing effect where she warps at.
Use [Walk] to Teleport to Chosen's Survivor location.
For 7 seconds, Zoey gains 33% damage reduction.
Zoey picks up allies faster an additional 5% Faster per talent level. [25% max]
Drops a healing circle at the Target's location.
-Heal 4 hp per second.
-7 second duration.
Can't be used while Zoey is grappled or downed.
Gain a Usage every other level after the 1st.
Global usage max of 3.

Addendum:  With this being Zoey's core bind strength, some values was adjusted and brought back a way for Zoey to get damage reduction to herself with out having to go down.  Global cooldown removed to express availability but reduced overall power with the healing power.  Global cooldowns should prevent Zoey stacking.
